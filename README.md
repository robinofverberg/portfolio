## Coding standard

- All variables are in English, start with lowercase letters and subsequent words start with uppercase letters (camelCase). Eventual snake_case is from/for bootstrap.
- We use four blank spaces for indentation.
- All test functions have to start with "test".
- English file names only contain lowercase letters. Except for pictures, which have no standard.
- Comments are positioned above the or next to the code depending on how the formatter formats it, are only in English and start with Uppercase.
- Python files follow the Black Formatter standard and Pylint with the exception of C0111 and method-naming-style=camelCase.
